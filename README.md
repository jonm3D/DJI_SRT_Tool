# DJI Flight Path Inspector

## Overview

This project aims to provide tools for inspecting and exporting flight path data from SRT files generated by a DJI Mini 4 Pro. The primary script, `srt.py`, parses the SRT files to extract metadata, generates a CSV and GeoJSON file, and creates visualizations of the flight path.

## Outputs

When you run the script on a DJI SRT file, it generates the following outputs:

- **CSV File:** Contains the extracted metadata for each frame.
- **GeoJSON File:** Represents the flight path as a LineString.
- **PNG Plot:** A visualization of the flight path with a top-down view+satellite basemap and a 3D oblique view.
