# DJI Flight Path Inspector

## Overview

This project provides tools to inspect and export flight path data from SRT files generated by a DJI Mini 4 Pro. The main script, `srt.py`, parses the SRT files to extract metadata, generate a CSV and GeoJSON file, and create visualizations of the flight path.

![Flight Path Example](https://github.com/jonm3D/DJI_SRT_Tool/blob/main/example/DJI_20240614201546_0037_D/DJI_20240614201546_0037_D_flight_summary.gif?raw=true)

## Outputs
When you run the script on a DJI SRT file, it generates the following outputs:

- **CSV File:** Contains the extracted metadata for each frame.
- **GeoJSON File:** Represents the flight path as a LineString.
- **Summary PNG:** A visualization of the flight path with a top-down view+satellite basemap and a 3D oblique view.
